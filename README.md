# Overview
This repository contains all the code needed to complete the final project for the Localization course in Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree.

#### Submission
All you will submit is your completed version of `particle_filter.cpp`, which is located in the `src` directory. You should probably do a `git pull` before submitting to verify that your project passes the most up-to-date version of the grading code (there are some parameters in `src/main.cpp` which govern the requirements on accuracy and run time.)

## Project Introduction
Your robot has been kidnapped and transported to a new location! Luckily it has a map of this location, a (noisy) GPS estimate of its initial location, and lots of (noisy) sensor and control data.

In this project you will implement a 2 dimensional particle filter in C++. Your particle filter will be given a map and some initial localization information (analogous to what a GPS would provide). At each time step your filter will also get observation and control data. 

## Running the Code
This project involves the Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)

This repository includes two files that can be used to set up and intall uWebSocketIO for either Linux or Mac systems. For windows you can use either Docker, VMware, or even Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu to install uWebSocketIO.

Once the install for uWebSocketIO is complete, the main program can be built and ran by doing the following from the project top directory.

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./particle_filter

Alternatively some scripts have been included to streamline this process, these can be leveraged by executing the following in the top directory of the project:

1. ./clean.sh
2. ./build.sh
3. ./run.sh

### Visual Studio on Windows

1. Clone this repo.
2. Use [this](https://github.com/fkeidel/CarND-Term2-ide-profile-VisualStudio) repo to install the necessary dependencies for Visual Studio.
   Do not copy the `main.cpp` file and don't perform any changes on the `CMakeLists.txt` file as they are already modified to facilitate compilation on both VS and GNU environment.
3. Open the solution generated inside `./products` folder on your Visual Studio Environment.

During the installation of some libraries with vcpkg some of the mirrors may be inactive. You may alter the vcpkg to search into another mirror.



## Inputs to the Particle Filter
You can find the inputs to the particle filter in the `data` directory. 

#### The Map*
`map_data.txt` includes the position of landmarks (in meters) on an arbitrary Cartesian coordinate system. Each row has three columns
1. x position
2. y position
3. landmark id

### All other data the simulator provides, such as observations and controls.

> * Map data provided by 3D Mapping Solutions GmbH.
